# Creepy Computer Games

## About the Book

_Creepy Computer Games_ is one of the classic **Usborne** computer books from the 1980s, filled with eerie, humorous, and imaginative programs that turned early home computers into haunted playgrounds.

Written for the **ZX-81**, **ZX Spectrum**, **BBC**, **TRS-80**, **Apple**, **VIC-20**, **Dragon**, and **Oric**, these games invite you to explore spooky crypts, haunted houses, and ghostly mazes — all while learning to program in BASIC.

Each game includes a thrilling story, clear listing, and ideas for experiments — just like the original books that made programming fun and approachable for beginners.
