# Computer Spacegames

## About the Book

_Computer Spacegames_ is one of the classic Usborne computer books from the 1980s, featuring a collection of space-themed games that introduced kids and adults alike to the world of programming. Written for early home computers such as the ZX-81, ZX Spectrum, BBC, TRS-80, Apple, VIC, and PET, the book made programming approachable and fun through engaging stories and challenges set in outer space.

The book also included detailed instructions on how to modify and extend the games, empowering users to experiment and learn programming through creativity and problem-solving.

## Why Adapt This Book?

The games in _Computer Spacegames_ are timeless examples of how coding can be fun, educational, and creative. By adapting these games into modern programming languages, we:

- Keep the magic of the original book alive for new generations.
- Provide a hands-on way to learn coding concepts in modern contexts.
- Honor the creativity and innovation of 1980s computing.

## Organization

Each game from the book is presented in its own Markdown file. These files include:

- **The story** behind the game.
- **Pseudocode** to outline the game's logic.
- **Flowchart** to visualize the game's structure.
- **Code translations** in modern languages (C#, Python, Java, Go, C++, and Rust).
- **Beginner-friendly comments** to help new coders understand key concepts.
- **Challenges** to make the games harder or expand their functionality.

You can explore each game by navigating through the files in this folder.
