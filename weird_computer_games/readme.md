# Weird Computer Games

## About the Book

**Weird Computer Games** is one of the classic Usborne computer books from the 1980s, written by Jenny Tyler and Chris Oxlade. It features a collection of quirky, imaginative games designed to introduce kids and adults alike to the world of programming. Originally written for early home computers like the ZX-81, BBC Micro, and Commodore 64, the book's games focused on engaging stories and challenges to make learning BASIC fun and interactive.

The book emphasizes hands-on coding, encouraging readers to type out, debug, and experiment with the programs while also inviting them to expand and adapt the games creatively.

## Games Included

The book contains the following games:

1. [**Tower of Terror**](./tower_of_terror.md) - A spooky adventure where you must navigate a haunted tower.
2. [**Skulls of the Pyramid**](./skulls_of_the_pyramid.md) - A treasure-hunting challenge in a mysterious pyramid.

## Why Adapt This Book?

The games in **Weird Computer Games** are timeless examples of how coding can be creative, educational, and fun. By adapting these games into modern programming languages, we:

- Preserve the charm and educational value of the original book for new generations.
- Provide a hands-on way to learn coding concepts with ZX-81 BASIC, C#, and Python.
- Honor the ingenuity and creativity of early computing.

## Organization

Each game from the book is presented in its own Markdown file. These files include:

- **The story** behind the game.
- **Code translations** in ZX-81 BASIC, C#, and Python.
- **Beginner-friendly comments** to help new coders understand key concepts.
- **Challenges** to extend the games or add new features.
